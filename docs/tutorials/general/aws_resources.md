# Using AWS resources and services in `AutoGluonRAG`. 

To use any AWS resources, you need to make sure you have an appropriate AWS account with access to the required resources. Additionally, you will need to set up your access credentials.

You can either use the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html) or manually set the AWS Keys in your command line configuration file (`bash_profile` or `zshrc` file). If you are doing it manually, make sure to set the following parameters: 
    - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
    - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
    - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`
