## Vector Database Module

This module is responsible for creating a Vector Database and storing the vectors (embeddings) generated by the Embedding Module. Duplicate embeddings are not stored by default to ensure the efficiency and accuracy of the search operations.

### What are Duplicate Embeddings?

Duplicate embeddings are embeddings that represent very similar or identical data points. Storing these duplicates can lead to redundancy, increased storage requirements, and degraded performance during similarity searches.

### How We Handle Duplicate Embeddings

We identify and remove duplicate embeddings based on a configurable similarity threshold. The similarity between embeddings is calculated using a specified similarity function (e.g., cosine, euclidean, or manhattan). If the similarity score between two embeddings exceeds the defined threshold, one of them is considered a duplicate and is removed. This deduplication process ensures that the vector database remains efficient for retrieval tasks.

###  Configuration
Here are the configurable parameters for this module:
```
vector_db:
  db_type: The type of Vector DB (Currently, only 'faiss' and 'milvus' are supported).

  params: What parameters to use for the Vector DB. For example, `{gpu: False}`.

  similarity_threshold: The threshold for considering embeddings as duplicates based on a similarity function (default is `0.95`).

  similarity_fn: The similarity function used for determining similarity scores for embeddings. Options are `cosine`, `euclidean`, `manhattan` (default is `cosine`).

  use_existing_vector_db: Boolean to decide whether or not to use an existing, stored Vector DB Index from disk memory. Note that we do not support using an existing Milvus database. This flag can only be used with FAISS.

  vector_db_index_path: The Path to an existing, stored Vector DB Index file in disk memory or S3.

  num_gpus: Number of GPUs to use when building the index
  
  metadata: Metadata for each embedding stored in the database

  metadata_index_path: The Path to an existing, stored Metadata JSON file in disk memory or S3. Note that we do not support using an existing Milvus database

  s3_bucket: If applicable, S3 bucket that contains vector DB index and metadata files 

  milvus_db_name: Name of the Milvus DB Client

  milvus_collection_name: Name of the Milvus Collection. A DB can have multiple collections but we only use one here

  milvus_search_params: Additional Params to pass into the search function for Milvus when retrieving embeddings

  milvus_index_params: Additional Params to pass into the create_collection function for Milvus when creating the index

  milvus_create_params: Additional Params to pass into the create_collection function for Milvus when creating the collections
```
