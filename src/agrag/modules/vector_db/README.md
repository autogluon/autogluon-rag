## Embedding Module

This module is responsible for creating a Vector Database and storing the vectors (embeddings) generated by the Embedding Module.
Duplicate Embeddings are not stored by default.

Here are the configurable parameters for this module:
```
vector_db:
  db_type: The type of Vector DB (Currently, only FAISS is supported).

  params: What parameters to use for the Vector DB. For example, `{gpu: False}`.

  similarity_threshold: The threshold for considering embeddings as duplicates based on cosine similarity (default is `0.95`).

  similarity_fn: The similarity function used for determining similarity scores for embeddings. Options are `cosine`, `euclidean`, `manhattan` (default is `cosine`).

  use_existing_vector_db: Boolean to decide whether or not to use an existing, stored Vector DB Index from disk memory.

  vector_db_index_path: The Path to an existing, stored Vector DB Index from disk memory.

```
